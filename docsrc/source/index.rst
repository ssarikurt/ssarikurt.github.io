We already know that :math: `\int_a x dx`

  :math:`a^2+b^2=c^2`

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
              
.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      \int_a & = & x dx \\
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}
   
.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.
